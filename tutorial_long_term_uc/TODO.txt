1) JSON file with ERAA available values versus rest of static params in another JSON file (easier for students).
And set available aggreg. prod type PER COUNTRY - to facilitate exercise
2) Set interco_capas.csv file and integrate it instead of static values in code (common\constants)
3) Improve error msg when missing interco capa value (only couple corresponding to missing value, not list of all countries).
And lexicographically ordered
4) Add possibility to set Stock (additional to ERAA data) in JSON tb modif input file
5) Add possibility to provide additional fatal demand -> for iterations between UC and imperfect disaggreg..
6) Check multiple links between two zones possible. Cf. ger-scandinavia AC+DC in CentraleSup√©lec students hypothesis
And types ok? Q2Emmanuel NEAU and Jean-Yves BOURMAUD
7) Add plot functions to get demand/cf/capas values for the selected values of params (and selected period)
